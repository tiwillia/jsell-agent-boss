## Communication Protocol

### Coordinator (8899)

All agents use `localhost:8899` exclusively.

Space: `{SPACE}`

### Endpoints

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Post (JSON) | `curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8899/spaces/{SPACE}/agent/{name} -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Agent-Name: {name}' -d '{"status":"...","summary":"...","items":[...]}'` |
| Post (text) | `curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8899/spaces/{SPACE}/agent/{name} -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -H 'X-Agent-Name: {name}' --data-binary @/tmp/my_update.md` |
| Send message | `curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8899/spaces/{SPACE}/agent/{target}/message -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Agent-Name: {sender}' -d '{"message":"..."}'` |
| Read section | `curl -s http://localhost:8899/spaces/{SPACE}/agent/{name}` |
| Read full doc | `curl -s http://localhost:8899/spaces/{SPACE}/raw` |
| Browser | `http://localhost:8899/spaces/{SPACE}/` (polls every 3s) |

### Rules

1. **Read before you write.** Always `GET /raw` first.
2. **Post to your endpoint only.** Use `POST /spaces/{SPACE}/agent/{name}`.
3. **Identify yourself.** Every POST requires `-H 'X-Agent-Name: {name}'` matching the URL. The server rejects cross-channel posts (403).
4. **Tag questions with `[?BOSS]`** — they render highlighted in the dashboard.
5. **Concise summaries.** Always Use "{name}: {summary}" (required!).
6. **Safe writes.** Write to a temp file first, then POST with `--data-binary @/tmp/file.md`.
7. **Report your location and metrics.** Include `"branch"`, `"pr"`, `"jira"`, `"test_count"`, and `"repo_url"` in every POST. `"branch"` is the git branch you are working on. `"pr"` is the merge request number (e.g. `"#699"`). `"jira"` is the Jira issue key (e.g. `"OCPAPI-1234"`) — **every PR must have an associated Jira issue**. `"test_count"` is the number of passing tests. `"repo_url"` is the full HTTPS URL of your GitLab repository (e.g. `"https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ocm/platform"`). All five are **required** whenever applicable — the dashboard uses `repo_url` + `pr` to create clickable links to merge requests and `jira` to link to Red Hat Jira. `repo_url` is **sticky** like `tmux_session` — send it once and the server preserves it.

> **IMPORTANT: `repo_url` is REQUIRED in your first POST.** Without it, PR links in the dashboard are broken. Find it with `git remote get-url origin` and include it as `"repo_url": "https://..."`. You only need to send it once — the server remembers it.
8. **Register your tmux session.** Include `"tmux_session"` in your **first** POST so the coordinator can send you check-in broadcasts. Find your session name with `tmux display-message -p '#S'`. This field is **sticky** — the server preserves it automatically on subsequent POSTs, so you only need to send it once.
9. **Check your messages.** When you read `/raw`, look for a `#### Messages` section under your agent name. These are messages from the boss or other agents. Acknowledge them in your next status POST and act on any instructions. To send a message to another agent, POST to `/spaces/{SPACE}/agent/{target}/message` with `X-Agent-Name` set to your name and a JSON body `{"message": "..."}`.
10. **Model economy.** Status check-ins (`boss check`) are read/post operations — not heavy reasoning. Use a lightweight model (e.g. Haiku) for check-ins, then switch back to your working model (e.g. Opus) for real work. The broadcast script handles this automatically via `/model` switching.
